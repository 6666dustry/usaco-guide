[Official Analysis (C++)](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/sol_lostcow_bronze_open17.html)

## Explanation

At each step, we check where Farmer John starts and where he's trying to go. If his path doesn't overlap with
Bessie's path, we add the distance he convers to a running total and move him to his starting position.
But if his path somehow overlaps with Bessie's, we only need to add his distance from Bessie to the total.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(\log|x-y|)$

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>

int main() {

	std::ifstream cin("lostcow.in");
	std::ofstream cout("lostcow.out");
	int x, y;
	cin >> x >> y;

	int direction = 1;
	int total_distance = 0;
	int direction_distance = 1;

	while (true) {
		// found bessie
		if ((direction == 1 && x <= y && y <= (x + direction_distance)) ||
		    (direction == -1 && y <= x && (x - direction_distance) <= y)) {
			total_distance +=
			    std::abs(y - x);  // distance to bessie from original position
			cout << total_distance << std::endl;
			break;
		} else {  // bessie not found
			total_distance += direction_distance * 2;
			direction_distance *= 2;
			direction *= -1;  // switch directions
		}
	}
}
```

				totalDistance +=
				    Math.abs(y - x);  // distance to bessie from original position
				io.println(totalDistance);
				break;
			} else {                                       // did not find bessie yet
				totalDistance += (directionDistance * 2);  // add to the distance count
				directionDistance *= 2;                    // double the distance
				direction *= -1;                           // switch directions

## Explanation

We can initially attempt this problem by figuring out which firecrackers should explode. Obviously, we should attempt to explode the firecrackers with a minimal
detonation time to increase the number of firecrackers exploded before eventually being caught. Also, observe that the firecrackers with a longer detonation
time should be dropped first.

To find the maximum number of firecrackers before the hooligan gets caught by the guard, sort the detonation times in increasing order and figure out the
maximum number of firecrackers to drop before getting caught by applying binary search.

If we can determine the amount of time before getting caught, then the binary search will be trivial.

There are two cases which determine the amount of time before getting caught:

1. It can be proven that if $a < b$, then the amount of time before getting caught is precisely $b - 1$ seconds.
2. It can be proven that if $a > b$, then the amount of time before getting caught is precisely $n - b$ seconds.

**Note: these times are computed by assuming that both the hooligan and guard act optimally.**

After computing the amount of time before getting caught, we can simulate whether a particular firecracker will explode in time.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$

        int num_of_firecrackers;
        int hooligan_location;
        int guard_location;

        std::cin >> corridor_size >> num_of_firecrackers >> hooligan_location >> guard_location;
        std::vector<int> exploding_times(num_of_firecrackers);

        }

        std::sort(begin(exploding_times), end(exploding_times));

	    //  Compute the maximum time before the guard catches the
	    //  hooligan given their initial positions.
        int time_before_caught = 0; 
        if (hooligan_location < guard_location) {

        } else if (hooligan_location > guard_location) {

        }

        auto works = [&] (int firecrackers_exploded) -> bool {
            int curr_time = 1;
            for (int i = firecrackers_exploded - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                // Check whether a given firecracker could be exploded
		        // before being caught by the guard.
                if (curr_time + exploding_times[i] > time_before_caught) {
                    return false;
                } else {
                    curr_time++;
                }
            }
            return true;
        };

        int lo = 0, hi = max_firecrackers;
        int max_exploded = 0;

        while (lo <= hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if (works(mid)) {
                max_exploded = mid;
                lo = mid + 1;
            } else {
                hi = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        std::cout << max_exploded << '\n';
    }
}
